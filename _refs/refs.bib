  abstract  = {Constitutive modelling is the mathematical description of how materials respond to various loadings. This is the most intensely researched field within solid mechanics because of its complexity and the importance of accurate constitutive models for practical engineering problems. Topics covered include: Elasticity - Plasticity theory - Creep theory - The nonlinear finite element method - Solution of nonlinear equilibrium equations - Integration of elastoplastic constitutive equations - The thermodynamic framework for constitutive modelling Thermoplasticity - Uniqueness and discontinuous bifurcations More comprehensive in scope than competitive titles, with detailed discussion of thermodynamics and numerical methods. Offers appropriate strategies for numerical solution, illustrated by discussion of specific models. Demonstrates each topic in a complete and self-contained framework, with extensive referencing.},

@book{Bigoni.2012,
  abstract  = {{\textquotedbl}This book covers solid mechanics for non-linear elastic and elastoplastic materials, describing the behaviour of ductile material subject to extreme mechanical loading and its eventual failure. The book highlights constitutive features to describe the behaviour of frictional materials such as geological media. On the basis of this theory, including large strain and inelastic behaviours, bifurcation and instability are developed with a special focus on the modelling of the emergence of local instabilities such as shear band formation and flutter of a continuum. The former is regarded as a precursor of fracture, while the latter is typical of granular materials. The treatment is complemented with qualitative experiments, illustrations from everyday life and simple examples taken from structural mechanics{\textquotedbl}--},
