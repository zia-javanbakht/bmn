@article{Celino.2014,
 abstract = {Environmental concern has resulted in a renewed interest in bio-based materials. Among them, plant fibres are perceived as an environmentally friendly substitute to glass fibres for the reinforcement of composites, particularly in automotive engineering. Due to their wide availability, low cost, low density, high-specific mechanical properties and eco-friendly image, they are increasingly being employed as reinforcements in polymer matrix composites. Indeed, their complex microstructure as a composite material makes plant fibre a really interesting and challenging subject to study. Research subjects about such fibres are abundant because there are always some issues to prevent their use at large scale (poor adhesion, variability, low thermal resistance, hydrophilic behavior). The choice of natural fibres rather than glass fibres as filler yields a change of the final properties of the composite. One of the most relevant differences between the two kinds of fibre is their response to humidity. Actually, glass fibres are considered as hydrophobic whereas plant fibres have a pronounced hydrophilic behavior. Composite materials are often submitted to variable climatic conditions during their lifetime, including unsteady hygroscopic conditions. However, in humid conditions, strong hydrophilic behaviour of such reinforcing fibres leads to high level of moisture absorption in wet environments. This results in the structural modification of the fibres and an evolution of their mechanical properties together with the composites in which they are fitted in. Thereby, the understanding of these moisture absorption mechanisms as well as the influence of water on the final properties of these fibres and their composites is of great interest to get a better control of such new biomaterials. This is the topic of this review paper.},

 abstract = {In the current study, the representative volume element (RVE) is used to model randomly generated nanocomposite structures consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in an epoxy resin matrix. The finite element Method is utilized for numerical simulations and investigation of the influential parameters on the generated RVEs. In order to automatize the whole procedure - fromgenerating the finite element models to conducting the analyses - a subroutine-based programming approach is adopted using the MSC Marc finite element package and Fortran programming language. The simulations can successfully predict the increase in thermal conductivity of CNT-reinforced nanocomposites by increasing the fiber volume fraction.},

 abstract = {Eshelby's theory is the foundation of composite mechanics, allowing calculation of the effective elastic moduli of composites from a knowledge of their microstructure. However, it ignores interfacial stress and only applies to very dilute composites-i.e. where any inclusions are widely spaced apart. Here, within the framework of the Mori-Tanaka multiphase approximation scheme, we extend Eshelby's theory to treat a composite with interfacial stress in the non-dilute limit. In particular, we calculate the elastic moduli of composites comprised of a compliant, elastic solid hosting a non-dilute distribution of identical liquid droplets. The composite stiffness depends strongly on the ratio of the droplet size, R, to an elastocapillary lengthscale, L. Interfacial tension substantially impacts the effective elastic moduli of the composite when [Formula: see text]. When R{\textless}3L/2 (R=3L/2) liquid inclusions stiffen (cloak the far-field signature of) the solid.},

Early models assumed that no thermal resistance exists between the phases in heterogeneous material. Later studies on solid-liquid and solid-solid boundaries revealed that a temperature drop occurs when heat flows through a boundary between two phases and, as a consequence, the interfacial thermal resistance should be included in the heat transfer model. This paper is a review of the most popular expressions for predicting the eective thermal conductivity of composite materials using the properties and volume fractions of constituent phases. Subject to review were empirical, analytical and numerical models, among others.},

 abstract = {The prediction of hygroscopic swelling of flexible polymer substrates is crucial in various fields from smart structures to flexible electronics. In this study, the prediction method for time-dependent hygroscopic deformation is presented by employing the finite element method (FEM). In order to precisely consider the strain gradients inside the substrate, moisture distribution depending on time is quantitatively investigated by a moisture absorption analysis and sequentially combined with a mechanical deformation analysis. The essential hygroscopic properties including the saturated moisture content, moisture diffusivity, and the coefficient of moisture expansion are precisely measured. Through the application of these hygroscopic properties to a hygro-mechanical analysis model, the moisture distribution and the hygroscopic deformation are quantitatively simulated with time. For the verification of this model, the simulation results of bilayer structures are compared with the experimental results, which are measured using a three-dimensional deformation measurement system. The presented model demonstrates that the global and local hygroscopic deformations are accurately predicted by this approach, showing above 90{\%} averaged accuracy at each time step. These results can be obtained by precisely measured hygroscopic properties and the consideration of the effect of non-uniform distribution on the hygroscopic deformation.},

Using carefully selected examples, Singh and Heldman demonstrate the relationship of engineering to the chemistry, microbiology, nutrition and processing of foods in a uniquely practical blend.  This approach facilitates comprehensive learning that has proven valuable beyond the classroom as a lifetime professional reference. Key features in this edition: key concepts now communicated using audio, video, and animations; integrates interactive tools to aid in understanding complex charts and graphs; features virtual experiments of selected food processing operations; videos demonstrating key processes and engineering in practice; presents a practical, unique and challenging blend of principles and ap plication for comprehensive learning. Authors Singh and Heldman use their many years of teaching to present food engineering concepts in a logical progression that covers the standard course curriculum making it easily adaptable for each classroom{\textquotedbl} -- Page 4 of cover.},
