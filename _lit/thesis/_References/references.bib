 abstract = {A Generalized Multiscale Analysis Approach brings together comprehensive background information on the multiscale nature of the composite, constituent material behaviour, damage models and key techniques for multiscale modelling, as well as presenting the findings and methods, developed over a lifetime's research, of three leading experts in the field. The unified approach presented in the book for conducting multiscale analysis and design of conventional and smart composite materials is also applicable for structures with complete linear and nonlinear material behavior, with numerous applications provided to illustrate use. Modeling composite behaviour is a key challenge in research and industry; when done efficiently and reliably it can save money, decrease time to market with new innovations and prevent component failure.--},

 abstract = {In the last decade the author has been engaged in developing a micromechanical composite model based on the study of interacting periodic cells. In this two-phase model, the inclusion is assumed to occupy a single cell whereas the matrix material occupies several surrounding cells. A prominent feature of the micromechanical method of cells is the transition from a medium, with a periodic microstructure to an equivalent homogeneous continuum which effectively represents the composite material. Of great importance is the significant advantage of the cells model in its capability to analyze elast.},

@book{Adams.2009,
 abstract = {Fortran continues to be the premier language used in scientific and engineering computing since its introduction in the 1950s. Fortran 2003 is the latest standard version and has many excellent modern features that assist programmers in writing efficient, portable and maintainable programs that are useful for everything from hard science to text processing. The Fortran 2003 Handbook is the definitive and comprehensive guide to Fortran 2003, the latest standard version of Fortran. This all-inclusive volume offers a reader-friendly, easy-to-follow and informal description of Fortran 2003, and has been developed to provide not only a readable explanation of features, but also some rationale for the inclusion of features and their use. Experienced Fortran 95 programmers will be able to use this volume to assimilate quickly those features in Fortran 2003 that are not in Fortran 95 (Fortran 2003 contains all of the features of Fortran 95). Features and benefits: The complete syntax of Fortran 2003 is supplied. Each of the intrinsic standard procedures is described in detail. There is a complete listing of the new, obsolescent, and deleted features. Numerous examples are given throughout, providing insights into intended uses and interactions of the features. IEEE module procedures are covered thoroughly. Chapters begin with a summary of the main terms and concepts described. Models provide the reader with insight into the language. Key Topics: Fortran Concepts and Terms Language Elements and Source Form Data Types Block Constructs and Execution Control I/O Processing and Editing Interoperability with C Standard Intrinsic Procedures This highly versatile and authoritative handbook is intended for anyone who wants a comprehensive survey of Fortran 2003, including those familiar with programming language concepts but unfamiliar with Fortran. It offers a practical description of Fortran 2003 for professionals developing sophisticated application and commercial software in Fortran, as well as developers of Fortran compilers. All authors have been heavily involved in the development of Fortran standards. They have served on national and international Fortran standard development committees, and include a chair, convenors and editors of the Fortran 90, 95, and 2003 standards. In addition, Walt Brainerd is the owner of The Fortran Company, Tucson, AZ, USA.},

Some of these applications are now realized in products. Others are demonstrated in early to advanced devices, and one, hydrogen storage, is clouded by controversy. Nanotube cost, polydispersity in nanotube type, and limitations in processing and assembly methods are important barriers for some applications of single-walled nanotubes.},

@article{Bazant.1976,
 abstract = {Analysis of structural instability due to strain-softening (i. e. , declining branch of the stress-strain diagram) is presented. In a continuum, strain-softening is impossible; it can exist only in a heterogeneous material. Failure occurs by unstable localization of strain or beam curvature, in which the stored strain energy of the structure is transferred into a small strain-softening region whose size is several times the aggregate size, or the spacing of reinforcement, or the depth of the beam. The existence of a lower limit on the size of this region permits ductility, along with its dependence on the size and stored energy, to be predicted by a stability analysis. Calculations of limit loads and moment redistributions in strain-softening beams and frames must include instability checks of possible curvature localization. The same applies to finite element analyses of reinforced concrete structures with account of tensile cracking, and predictions of limit loads of these structures which are questionable because they depend on the size of the finite elements.},

We report high-performance multifunctional carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers that combine the specific strength, stiffness, and thermal conductivity of carbon fibers with the specific electrical conductivity of metals. These fibers consist of bulk-grown CNTs and are produced by high-throughput wet spinning, the same process used to produce high-performance industrial fibers. These scalable CNT fibers are positioned for high-value applications, such as aerospace electronics and field emission, and can evolve into engineered materials with broad long-term impact, from consumer electronics to long-range power transmission.},

@article{Benveniste.1987,
 abstract = {This paper is a reconsideration and reformulation of the Mori-Tanaka's theory in its application to the computation of the effective properties of composites. Previous applications of the theory in this context continued to be linked with eigenstrain, equivalent inclusion, and back stress concepts, and many times involved energy considerations. In this paper we adopt the `direct approach' of defining and computing effective moduli. By elucidating the nature of the approximation in applying Mori---Tanaka's theory to composites insofar as the `concentration-factor' tensors are concerned, we achieve a straightforward exposition and interpretation of the method which are different than those existing in previous formulations. The analysis is given for two-phase composites with anisotropic elastic constituents and an inclusion phase consisting of aligned or randomly oriented ellipsoidal particles. The derived simple expressions for the predicted stiffness and compliance tensors permit a proof of the self-consistency of the method, a discussion of the predictions' relation to the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds in the case of isotropic constituents and randomly oriented ellipsoidal particles, and finally a derivation of some new results in randomly cracked bodies with penny-shaped cracks.},

Such local effects, as, for example, plastic deformation, yielding, strain-hardening, strain-softening, mechanical damage, matrix microcracking, aggregate debonding, fibre bridging, fibre slippage, crazing, and so on, are properly described through different simplified models, representing the peculiarities of the phenomena involved. The models are introduced and described separately and then compared in the last part of the book. This volume will be of interest to students, professionals and researchers in the field of nonlinear fracture mechanics.},

@book{Christensen.2012,
 abstract = {A comprehensive account of the basic theory of the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous media, this volume assembles, interprets, and interrelates contributions to the field of composite materials from theoretical research, laboratory developments, and product applications. The text focuses on the continuum mechanics aspects of behavior; specifically, it invokes idealized geometric models of the heterogeneous system to obtain theoretical predictions of macroscopic properties in terms of the properties of individual constituent materials. The wide range of subjects encompasses macroscopic stiffness properties, failure characterization, and wave propagation. Much of the book presumes a familiarity with the theory of linear elasticity; but it also takes into consideration behavior characterized by viscoelasticity and inviscid plasticity theories and problems involving nonlinear kinematics. Because of the close relationship between mechanical and thermal effects, the text also examines macroscopic, thermal properties of heterogeneous media. Although the primary emphasis centers on the development of theory, this volume also pays critical attention to the practical assessment of results and applications. Comparisons between different approaches and with reliable experimental data appear at main junctures. Suitable as a graduate-level text, Mechanics of Composite Materials is also a valuable reference for professionals.},

The fabric tensor is a symmetric second rank tensor which characterizes the geometric arrangement of the porous material microstructure. In developing this result it is assumed that the matrix material of the porous elastic solid is isotropic and, thus, that the anisotropy of the porous elastic solid is determined by the fabric tensor.

@article{Cowin.1992,
 abstract = {An insightful, structurally appealing and potentially utilitarian formulation of the anisotropic form of the linear Hooke's law due to Lord Kelvin was independently rediscovered by Rychlewski (1984, Prikl. Mat. Mekh. 48, 303) and Mehrabadi and Cowin (1990, Q. J. Mech. appl. Math. 43, 14). The eigenvectors of the three-dimensional fourth-rank anisotropic elasticity tensor, considered as a second-rank tensor in six-dimensional space, are called eigentensors when projected back into three-dimensional space. The maximum number of eigentensors for any elastic symmetry is therefore six. The concept of an eigentensor was introduced by Kelvin (1856, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. 166, 481) who called eigentensors ``the principal types of stress or of strain''. Kelvin determined the eigentensors for many elastic symmetries and gave a concise summary of his results in the 9th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1878). The eigentensors for a linear isotropic elastic material are familiar. They are the deviatoric second-rank tensor and a tensor proportional to the unit tensor, the spherical, hydrostatic or dilatational part of the tensor. Mehrabadi and Cowin (1990, Q. J. Mech. appl. Math. 43, 14) give explicit forms of the eigentensors for all of the linear elastic symmetries except monoclinic and triclinic symmetry. We discuss two approaches for the determination of eigentensors and illustrate these approaches by partially determining the eigentensors for monoclinic symmetry. With the nature of the eigentensors for monoclinic symmetry known, a rather complete table of the structural properties of all linear elastic symmetries can be constructed. The purpose of this communication is to give the most specifically detailed presentation of the eigenvalues and eigentensors of the Kelvin formulation to date.},

 abstract = {Nonwovens are polymer-based engineered textiles with a random microstructure and hence require a numerical model to predict their mechanical performance. This paper focuses on finite element (FE) modelling the elastic--plastic mechanical response of polymer-based core/sheath type thermally bonded bicomponent fibre nonwoven materials. The nonwoven fabric is treated as an assembly of two regions having distinct mechanical properties: fibre matrix and bond points. The fibre matrix is composed of randomly oriented core/sheath type fibres acting as load-transfer link between bond points. Random orientation of individual fibres is introduced into the model in terms of the orientation distribution function (ODF) in order to determine the material's anisotropy. The ODF is obtained by analysing the data acquired with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro computed tomography (CT). On the other hand, bond points are treated as a deformable bicomponent composite material composed of the sheath material as matrix and the core material as fibres having random orientations. An algorithm is developed to calculate the anisotropic material properties of these regions based on properties of fibres and manufacturing parameters such as the planar density, core/sheath ratio and fibre diameter. Having distinct anisotropic mechanical properties for two regions, the fabric is modelled with shell elements with thicknesses identical to those of the bond points and fibre matrix. Finally, nonwoven specimens are subjected to tensile tests along different loading directions with respect to the machine direction of the fabric. The force--displacement curves obtained in these tests are compared with the results of FE simulations.},

The most prominent one is the mechanical anisotropy leading to their direction-dependent deformation behaviour. This paper focuses on mechanical anisotropy of thermally bonded bicomponent fibre nonwovens with polymer-based bicomponent core/sheath fibres. A relation between mechanical anisotropy of these nonwovens and random orientation of their fibres is developed in this study. Random orientation of individual fibres is quantified in terms of the orientation distribution function (ODF) in order to determine the material's anisotropy. The ODF is obtained by analysing the data acquired with scanning electron microscopy or X-ray micro-computed tomography using digital image processing techniques based on the Hough transform. A numerical tool is developed to perform this analysis and determine the anisotropic parameters in order to define direction-dependency of the structure's mechanical properties. Finally, anisotropic parameters of various nonwovens computed with the introduced numerical approach are compared with those obtained from tensile tests applied in machine and cross directions of nonwovens.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the micromechanics of multi-phase fiber- or inclusion-reinforced inelastic composites with a special emphasis on the numerical treatment of misaligned orientation. Mean-field homogenization of these composites involves volume and orientation averaging. The latter usually needs average orientation measures known as the second- and fourth-rank orientation tensors a and A, respectively. Usually the only orientation data available is a and a first issue is to reconstruct A using closure approximations. We propose a new weighted regularization method which deals with orientations which are strictly neither 1D, 2D nor 3D and ensures a smooth transition between the 3 cases. A second issue is that there are situations where the inclusions' orientation distribution function (ODF) is needed for homogenization but is unavailable. The ODF is recovered using a and A and numerically computed at a number of discrete orientations. A third issue is the actual computation of orientation averaging integrals. An efficient algorithm approximates the integrals with sums over a finite number of orientations. Orientation and volume averaging concepts are applied to the mean-field homogenization of two classes of multi-phase composites: linear thermo-elastic and rate-independent inelastic. In the latter case, an incremental formulation is proposed which enables the simulation of unloading, cyclic and otherwise non-proportional loadings. Implicit time-discretization and consistent tangent operators are employed. The procedures and the corresponding algorithms were implemented in the [DIGIMAT version 1.4, 2004. Linear and nonlinear multi-scale material modeling software, e-Xstream engineering SA (http://www.e-Xstream.com), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.] software and several numerical simulations show their accuracy and efficiency.},

@article{Farukh.2014,
 abstract = {Understanding a mechanical behaviour of polymer-based nonwoven materials that include large-strain deformation and damage can help to evaluate a response of nonwoven fibrous networks to various loading conditions. Here, a nonwoven felt made by thermal bonding of polypropylene fibres was used as a model system. Its deformation and damage behaviour was analysed by means of experimental assessment of damage evolution based on single-fibre failure and finite-element simulations. Tensile tests of nonwoven fabrics were carried out to characterise their damage behaviour under in-plane mechanical loading. It was found that progressive failure of fibres led to localization of damage initiation and propagation, ultimately resulting in failure of the nonwoven felt. To obtain the criteria that control the onset and propagation of damage in these materials, tensile tests on single fibres, extracted from the felt with bond points attached to their ends, were performed. A finite-element model was developed to study damage initiation and propagation in nonwovens. In the model, structural randomness of a nonwoven fibrous network was implemented by means of direct introduction of fibres according to the orientation distribution function. The evolution of damage in the network was controlled by a single-fibre failure criterion obtained experimentally. The proposed numerical model not only captured the macroscopic response of the felt successfully but also reproduced the underlying mechanisms involved in deformation and damage of nonwovens.},

 abstract = {In the past years, soft-tissue modelling research has seen substantial developments, a significant part of which can be ascribed to the refinement of numerical techniques, such as Finite Element analysis. A large class of physico-mechanical properties can be effectively simulated and predictions can be made for a variety of phenomena. However, there is still much that can be conceptually explored by means of fundamental theoretical analysis. In the past few years, driven by our interest in articular cartilage mechanics, we have developed theoretical microstructural models for linear elasticity and permeability that accounted for the presence and arrangement of collagen fibres in cartilage. In this paper, we investigate analytically the non-linear elasticity of soft tissues with collagen fibres arranged according to a given distribution of orientation, a problem that, aside from the case of fibres aligned in a finite number of distinct directions, has been treated exclusively numerically in the literature. We show that, for the case of a tissue with complex fibre arrangement, such as articular cartilage, the theoretical framework commonly used leads to an integral expression of the elastic strain energy potential. The present model is a first attempt in the development of a unified analytical microstructural model for non-linear elasticity and permeability of hydrated, fibre-reinforced soft tissues.},

 abstract = {In the past years, soft-tissue modelling research has seen substantial developments, a significant part of which can be ascribed to the refinement of numerical techniques, such as Finite Element analysis. A large class of physico-mechanical properties can be effectively simulated and predictions can be made for a variety of phenomena. However, there is still much that can be conceptually explored by means of fundamental theoretical analysis. In the past few years, driven by our interest in articular cartilage mechanics, we have developed theoretical microstructural models for linear elasticity and permeability that accounted for the presence and arrangement of collagen fibres in cartilage. In this paper, we investigate analytically the non-linear elasticity of soft tissues with collagen fibres arranged according to a given distribution of orientation, a problem that, aside from the case of fibres aligned in a finite number of distinct directions, has been treated exclusively numerically in the literature. We show that, for the case of a tissue with complex fibre arrangement, such as articular cartilage, the theoretical framework commonly used leads to an integral expression of the elastic strain energy potential. The present model is a first attempt in the development of a unified analytical microstructural model for non-linear elasticity and permeability of hydrated, fibre-reinforced soft tissues.},

 abstract = {A general method called FE2 has been introduced which consists in describing the behavior of heterogeneous structures using a multiscale finite element model. Instead of trying to build differential systems to establish a stress-strain relation at the macroscale, a finite element computation of the representative volume element is carried out simultaneously. Doing so does not require any constitutive equations to be written at the macroscopic scale: all non-linearities come directly from the microscale. In this paper, we describe how this method can be used in the context of generalized continua. For such continua, constitutive equations are very difficult to write, and a new set of material is difficult to fit to experimental data. The use of FE2 models bypasses this problem because no analytical equation is needed at the macroscale. An academic application is presented to show that generalized continua are necessary when the size of the heterogeneities increases, and that FE2 models behave well compared to a reference solution.},

@article{Gasser.2006,
 abstract = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics, and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to capture accurately the stress-strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel {\&} Gasser (Holzapfel {\&} Gasser 2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379-4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1-48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter that characterizes the dispersed collagen orientation. An efficient finite element implementation of the model is then presented and numerical examples show that the dispersion of the orientation of collagen fibres in the adventitia of human iliac arteries has a significant effect on their mechanical response.},

We generalize previous work which has concentrated mainly on linear double porosity elastic materials or has had a particular structure in the nonlinearities. Here we allow the strain energy function and the effective permeabilities associated to the macro and micro porosity structures to be general nonlinear functions of the deformation gradient, macro and micro pressure gradients and of the macro and micro pressures themselves. A fully nonlinear acceleration wave analysis is developed. The general three-dimensional propagation condition is derived and it is shown how the permeabilities and pressure gradients alter the acoustic tensor with inevitable consequences for wavespeeds and for propagation conditions. The amplitude equation for an acceleration wave is derived and is completely analysed in the one-dimensional situation for a wave moving into a state with constant strain and constant macro and micro pressures.},

@article{Gizzi.2016,
 abstract = {We discuss analytical and numerical tools for the statistical characterization of the anisotropic strain energy density of soft hyperelastic materials embedded with fibers. We consider spatially distributed orientations of fibers following a tridimensional or a planar architecture. We restrict our analysis to material models dependent on the fourth pseudo-invariant I4 of the Cauchy--Green tensor, and to exponential forms of the fiber strain energy function \textgreek{Y}aniso. Under different loading conditions, we derive the closed-form expression of the probability density function for I4 and \textgreek{Y}aniso. In view of bypassing the cumbersome extension--contraction switch, commonly adopted for shutting down the contribution of contracted fibers in models based on generalized structure tensors, for significant loading conditions we identify analytically the support of the fibers in pure extension. For uniaxial loadings, the availability of the probability distribution function and the knowledge of the support of the fibers in extension yield to the analytical expression of average and variance of I4 and \textgreek{Y}aniso, and to the direct definition of the average second Piola--Kirchhoff stress tensor. For generalized loadings, the dependence of I4 on the spatial orientation of the fibers can be analyzed through angle plane diagrams. Angle plane diagrams facilitate the assessment of the influence of the pure extension condition on the definition of the stable support of fibers for the statistics related to the anisotropic strain energy density.},

@article{Guo.2016,
 abstract = {A hierarchical multiscale modeling approach is used to investigate three-dimensional (3D) strain localization in granular media. Central to the multiscale approach is a hierarchical coupling of finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM), wherein the FEM is employed to treat a boundary value problem of a granular material and the required constitutive relation for FEM is derived directly from the DEM solution of a granular assembly embedded at each of the FEM Gauss integration points as the representative volume element (RVE). While being effective in reproducing the complex mechanical responses of granular media, the hierarchical approach helps to bypass the necessity of phenomenological constitutive models commonly needed by conventional FEM studies and meanwhile offers a viable way to link the macroscopic observations with their underlying microscopic mechanisms. To model the phenomenon of strain localization, key issues pertaining to the selection of proper RVE packings are first discussed. The multiscale approach is then applied to simulate the strain localization problem in a cubical specimen and a cylindrical specimen subjected to either conventional triaxial compression (CTC) or conventional triaxial extension (CTE) loading, which is further compared to a case under plane-strain biaxial compression (PBC) loading condition. Different failure patterns, including localized, bulging and diffuse failure modes, are observed and analyzed. Amongst all testing conditions, the PBC condition is found most favorable for the formation of localized failure. The CTC test on the cubical specimen leads to a 3D octopus-shaped localization zone, whereas the cylindrical specimen under CTC shows seemingly bulging failure from the outlook but rather more complex failure patterns within the specimen. The CTE test on a uniform specimen normally ends in a diffuse failure. Different micro mechanisms and controlling factors underlying the various interesting observations are examined and discussed.},

 abstract = {An unstructured mesh Galerkin finite element method is used to obtain estimates of the viscoelastic moduli of short glass fiber reinforced polymer composites. Periodic Monte Carlo models with 125 identical inclusions are studied. Both spheroidal and spherocylindrical inclusions are considered. The estimates are compared against predictions of the dilute approximation, Mori-Tanaka (MT) and self-consistent (SC) models. It is shown that at small fiber fractions, the dilute approximation (Eshelby) model is exact. However, for the axial stiffness the dilute regime is limited to fiber volume loadings of a few tens of a percent while typical short glass fiber polymer composites have fiber loadings from 10 to 20 percent. It is found that in this concentrated regime, both MT and SC models give excellent predictions for all but the axial stiffness modulus. To assess the feasibility of reliable stiffness and vibration damping design of composite structures from short fiber reinforced polymers, Monte Carlo models with various fiber orientation distribution (FOD) states are studied. It is shown that the quick Voigt (constant strain) orientation averaging procedure gives excellent viscoelastic stiffness predictions provided that the finite element estimates are used for the required moduli of the basis FOD state with fully aligned fibers.},

 abstract = {Powders used in additive manufacturing (AM) are spread onto a compact layer of particles for sintering and this process is repeated layer by layer to form the final products. Spreading of rod-shaped particles in realistic AM settings is simulated using the discrete element method (DEM) to investigate the effects of particle shape and operating conditions on the bed quality, characterised by its surface roughness and solid volume fraction. It is discovered that larger particle aspect ratios, Ar, or higher spreader translational velocities result in a lower bed quality, i.e. a larger surface roughness and a smaller volume fraction. The surface roughness increases monotonically with Ar. However, the volume fraction exhibits a maximum at Ar=1.5 for randomly packed powder beds that are formed by the roller type spreaders moving at low translational velocities. It is also found that a roller outperforms a blade spreader in terms of the quality of the prepared bed at the same operating conditions. The micro-structural analysis of the beds also shows particle alignment in response to the induced flow, which is qualitatively confirmed by a set of purposely-designed experiments. In addition, a shape segregation is documented for powders with mixed aspect ratios (Ar) such that particles with larger Ar tend to accumulate on the upper layers of the bed.},

@article{Hansen.2017,
 abstract = {This study used subject-specific measures of three-dimensional (3D) free Achilles tendon geometry in conjunction with a finite element method to investigate the effect of variation in subject-specific geometry and subject-specific material properties on tendon stress during submaximal isometric loading. Achilles tendons of eight participants (Aged 25-35years) were scanned with freehand 3D ultrasound at rest and during a 70{\%} maximum voluntary isometric contraction. Ultrasound images were segmented, volume rendered and transformed into subject-specific 3D finite element meshes. The mean ($\pm$SD) lengths, volumes and cross-sectional areas of the tendons at rest were 62$\pm$13mm, 3617$\pm$984mm3 and 58$\pm$11mm2 respectively. The measured tendon strain at 70{\%} MVIC was 5.9$\pm$1.3{\%}. Subject-specific material properties were obtained using an optimisation approach that minimised the difference between measured and modelled longitudinal free tendon strain. Generic geometry was represented by the average mesh and generic material properties were taken from the literature. Local stresses were subsequently computed for combinations of subject-specific and generic geometry and material properties. For a given geometry, changing from generic to subject-specific material properties had little effect on the stress distribution in the tendon. In contrast, changing from generic to subject-specific geometry had a 26-fold greater effect on tendon stress distribution. Overall, these findings indicate that the stress distribution experienced by the living free Achilles tendon of a young and healthy population during voluntary loading are more sensitive to variation in tendon geometry than variation in tendon material properties.},

@article{Hessman.2019,
 abstract = {As a result of the injection molding process, short glass fiber reinforced thermoplastics (SFRT) exhibit complex microstructures with fibers of different length and orientation as well as spatially varying fiber volume fractions. Their mechanical and functional performance can therefore only be predicted and ensured based on precise knowledge of said microstructure. To that end, x-ray micro-computed tomography (\textgreek{m}CT) is commonly employed, with analysis software most-often yielding the fiber orientation tensors but lacking more detailed results. In order to increase the quality of the microstructural data, more accurate analysis techniques are necessary that include single fiber information for detailed correlations of microstructural parameters. In this work, a novel algorithm is suggested that relies on an iterative single fiber segmentation and merging procedure to obtain the fiber characteristics: orientation, location, radius and length. The algorithm is implemented in an efficient manner in Python, making heavy use of parallelization techniques. It is then applied to \textgreek{m}CT scans and artificially generated 3D data of short glass fiber reinforced polyamide 6.6 with fiber mass fractions of 35{\%}. The algorithm has been validated using reference data, commercial software and experimental fiber length data from an incinerated specimen and was shown to be both robust and accurate.},

 abstract = {Many soft fibrous solids consist of an isotropic matrix with strong embedded fibers. In continuum models of such materials it is often considered that the fibers do not support compression and that their contribution to the overall mechanical response should be neglected when they are under compression. A tension--compression `switch' is used to turn off the contribution of the fibers in the model, but it is apparent that an inappropriate switch is often adopted and the predictions of the mechanical response can then be significantly different for different switching criteria. On the basis of a simple illustration this paper draws attention to the consequences of using an inappropriate switch, and identifies possible solutions. One of the possible solutions for rectifying the problem is provided in some detail by introducing a modified fiber distribution model and applying it to both plane strain and three-dimensional transversely isotropic fiber distributions.},

The latter part of the paper concentrates on the macroscopic calculations, which is illustrated by the simulation of ultrasonic testing and a study of the attenuation dependency on material parameters and excitation frequency. The results endorse conclusions drawn from the experiments: increasing excitation frequency and material density cause increasing attenuation.},

 abstract = {This paperIvanova, Elena A.has many, albeitVilchevskaya, Elena N.mostlyM{\"u}ller, Wolfgang H.didactic objectives. It is an attempt toward clarification of several concepts of continuum theory which can lead and have led to confusion. In a way the paper also creates a bridge between the lingo of the solid mechanics and the fluid mechanics communities. More specifically, an attempt will be made, first, to explain and to interpret the subtleties and the relations between the so-called material and spatial description of continuum fields. Second, the concept of time derivatives in material and spatial description will be investigated meticulously. In particular, it will be explained why and how the so-called material and total time derivatives differ and under which circumstances they turn out to be the same. To that end, material and total time derivatives will be defined separately and evaluated in context with local fields as well as during their use in integral formulations, i.e., when applied to balance equations. As a special example the mass balance is considered for closed as well as open bodies. In the same context the concept of a ``moving observation point'' will be introduced leading to a generalization of the usual material derivative. When the total time derivative is introduced the distinction between the purely mathematical notion of a coordinate system and the intrinsically physics-based concept of a frame of reference will gain particular importance.},

 abstract = {In the current study, the representative volume element (RVE) is used to model randomly generated nanocomposite structures consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in an epoxy resin matrix. The finite element Method is utilized for numerical simulations and investigation of the influential parameters on the generated RVEs. In order to automatize the whole procedure - fromgenerating the finite element models to conducting the analyses - a subroutine-based programming approach is adopted using the MSC Marc finite element package and Fortran programming language. The simulations can successfully predict the increase in thermal conductivity of CNT-reinforced nanocomposites by increasing the fiber volume fraction.},

@article{Kanit.2006,
 abstract = {Three-dimensional confocal images of two materials A and B from food industry made of two constituents with highly contrasted properties, having the same volume fraction but different morphologies, are used to estimate their effective elastic and thermal properties. For that purpose, finite element simulations based on explicit meshing of the microstructures are performed on six samples of the materials, with different boundary conditions: kinematic uniform (KUBC), stress uniform (SUBC) and periodic boundary conditions. Direct simulations on the entire samples show that KUBC and SUBC provide strongly different apparent properties, which rises the question of the representativity of the samples. A numerical and statistical computational homogenization methodology first proposed for random models of microstructures in [Kanit et al., Determination of the size of the representative volume element for random composites: statistical and numerical approach, Int. J. Solids Struct. 40 (2003) 3647--3679] is extended here to the case of real microstructures in order to estimate the size of representative volume elements (RVE) for both materials. The samples of material A are found to be representative, whereas at least twice as large sample volumes would be necessary to predict the properties of material B with a precision of 5{\%}. Numerical predictions of the effective properties using simulations on a large number of subdomains extracted from the samples with periodic boundary conditions are in satisfactory agreement with available experimental results. In particular, material A is twice as stiff as material B. This is due to a different percolation behaviour of the hard phase in the materials, which is investigated in the last section of the article. Indicators of geometrical and mechanical percolation, especially relevant for connected microstructures, are proposed and estimated using 3D image analysis.},

The potentials of smart materials, the challenges of adaptive structures, the demands of thin-film technologiesand moreon the one hand and the availability of newly developed mathematical tools, the tremendous increase in computer facilities and the improvement of commercial software packages on the other caused a reanimation of the scientific interest. In the present book the contributions of the participants of the EUROMECH Colloquium 444 {\textquotedbl}Critical Review of the Theories of Plates and Shells and New Applications{\textquotedbl} have been collected. The aim was to discuss the common roots of different plate and shell approaches, to review the current state of the art, and to develop future lines of research. Contributions were written by scientists with civil and mechanical engineering as well as mathematical and physical background.},

 abstract = {Fracture mechanics has established itself as an important discipline of growing interest to those working to assess the safety, reliability and service life of engineering structures and materials. In order to calculate the loading situation at cracks and defects, nowadays numerical techniques like finite element method (FEM) have become indispensable tools for a broad range of applications. The present monograph provides an introduction to the essential concepts of fracture mechanics, its main goal being to procure the special techniques for FEM analysis of crack problems, which have to date only been mastered by experts. All kinds of static, dynamic and fatigue fracture problems are treated in two- and three-dimensional elastic and plastic structural components. The usage of the various solution techniques is demonstrated by means of sample problems selected from practical engineering case studies. The primary target group includes graduate students, researchers in academia and engineers in practice.},

@article{Lanir.1983,
 abstract = {A general multiaxial theory for the constitutive relations in fibrous connective tissues is developed on the basis of microstructural and thermodynamic considerations. It is compatible with existing general material theories. In elastic tissues, the theory considers the strain-energy function to be the sum of strain-energies of the tissue's components. The stresses are derived from this strain-energy function. Viscoelastic constitutive relations are obtained in an analogous manner. Few examples are developed in detail. The results of the present strain-energy based theory are identical with those of the author's previous structural models (Lanir, 1979a, b) which are based on detailed equilibrium analysis. It turns out, however, that the analytical work involved in solving boundary value problems is considerably shorter if the present theory is used. The advantages of structural theories in avoiding ambiguity in material characterization and in offering an insight into the function, structure and mechanics of tissue components are discussed.},

@article{Lau.2018,
 abstract = {Since the last two decades, many researchers have refocused on using natural fibres, as reinforcements for cementitious and polymer based structural materials. The use of natural fibres for structural applications is not modern. Long before a century ago people in many small towns in China and Korea already mixed straws with mud to build walls in villages. However, at that time there was no systematic way to study the fundamental mechanism and interpret how natural fibres strengthen structures and what processes should be adopted to maximize the performance of natural materials. Currently, nevertheless natural fibre reinforced polymer (NFRP) composites have been widely used in automotive and building industries, it is still a room to promote them to high-level structural applications like primary structural components of aerospace and maritime structures. It is difficult to evaluate the quality of natural fibres, which generally extracted from the nature, and thus it is challenging to develop a generic formula to predict the structural and mechanical properties of NFRP composites. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of natural fibres and polymers, respectively, cause poor bonding interaction at interface. Traditional shear-lag model was popularly used to study the stress transfer mechanism between fibre and matrix of advanced composites. However, such model is not applicable to NFRP composites due to the imperfect shape of nature fibres along their longitudinal direction and irregular shape of fibres' cross section. In this paper, analysis on different aspects in related to the use of natural fibres for real life engineering applications is given. Basic analytical models focusing on the stress transferability in composites are also discussed to provide an insight for researchers and engineers to understand the design and requirements of using natural fibres for structural applications in the future.},

The flow-induced fibre orientation is first calculated by numerical simulation, and the resulting orientation state is used as input in a micromechanical model that predicts the thermo-mechanical properties of the part. A two-step homogenization scheme based on the grain model approach is followed. First, the properties of a reference composite with aligned fibres are estimated by means of a mixture rule between the upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman bounds (derived by Willis). This method is in agreement with the Mori-Tanaka estimates for moderate concentrations, and gives better results for higher concentrations. Next, the properties of the composite are obtained by averaging several reference composites with different fibre directions. An example of a 3-D compression moulded composite part is analyzed and the results are discussed.},

 abstract = {This thoroughly revised and updated edition of the classic text on surface mechanics preserves the objectives of the original: the rigorous derivation of surface properties such as temperature and deformation from the differential equations of continuum mechanics. From such solutions for the surfaces of single bodies one can then formulate problems involving two bodies at rest or in relative motion in terms of a singular integral equation. The discussion is analytical and theoretical, but animated by the authors' decades of experience in applications and experimental mechanics. This new edition has been updated to include many technologically motivated problems and solutions, especially computer solutions. Beginning with a survey of the field equations of classical continuum mechanics, the book continues with a discussion of surface temperatures in moving bodies. It then turns to semi-infinite and layered elastic media, discussing stress and deformation as well as thermal stress and associate deformation fields. Treatments of viscoelasticity and perfect plasticity concentrate on semi-infinite solids; these are followed by a discussion of rough surfaces. The book concludes with a lengthy chapter of applications. An appendix discusses integral equations. Intended for graduate students of mechanics and mechanical engineering, the book will also be of interest to applied mathematicians and others interested in tribology.},

In contrast to conventional `singlephase elements' where the phase boundaries are simulated by element edges, the `multiphase element' can be assigned to different materials when a phase boundary runs across it. The 3D-multiphase element is firstly applied to a simple test geometry. The efficiency of the 3D-multiphase element method is demonstrated by the analysis of a more complex 3D-microstructure. Finally, for a comparison of 2D- and 3D-simulations the stress distribution obtained in the 3D-calculation is compared with the results of a 2D-simulation of a representative intersection of the microstructure.},

 abstract = {Polymer gels are widely accepted as candidate materials for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and orthopedic load-bearing applications. In addition, their mechanical and physical properties can be tailored to meet a wide range of design requirements. For soft gels whose elastic modulus is in the kPa range, mechanical characterization by bulk mechanical testing methods presents challenges, for example, in sample preparation, fixture design, gripping, and/or load measurement accuracy. Nanoindentation, however, has advantages when characterizing the mechanical properties of soft materials. This study was aimed at investigating the application of an inverse finite element analysis technique to identify material parameters of polymer gels via nanoindentation creep testing, optimization, and finite element simulation. Nanoindentation experiments were conducted using a rigid circular flat punch, and then simulated using the commercial software ABAQUS. The optimization (error minimization) procedure was integrated in the parameter determination process using a Matlab shell program, which makes this approach readily adaptable to other test geometries and material models. The finite element results compare well with a derived analytical viscoelastic solution for a rigid circular flat punch on a Kelvin-Voigt half-space.},

@article{Liu.2010,
 abstract = {Under complex environments such as continuous or cyclic loads, the stiffness degradation for the laminated composites such as the carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites is an important physical and mechanical response to the damage and failure evolution. It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates.},

 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}A tutorial guide that shows programmers how to apply features of Fortran 2008 in a modular, concise, object-oriented, and resource-efficient manner, using multiple processors{\textquotedbl}--

{\textquotedbl}Since the publication of the FORTRAN 77 standard in 1978 the Fortran language has undergone a large number of revisions [61].1 The changes that were introduced reflect both new insights in programming techniques and new developments in computer hardware. From the very start the language has been designed with computing efficiency in mind. The latest standard as of this writing, Fortran 2008, puts even more emphasis on this aspect by introducing explicit support for parallel processing [71]. This first chapter gives an overview of the various standards that have appeared after {\textquotedbl} FORTRAN 77{\textquotedbl}. There is no attempt to be complete or even to describe all major features - that would mean a whole book or even a series of books. Consult Metcalf et al. [63], [65] or Brainerd et al. [36] for a detailed Officially, Fortran 77 should be written as FORTRAN 77. Since the Fortran 90 standard the name is written in lowercase. description of the standards. 1.1 The flavour of modern Fortran The Fortran 90 standard introduced some very significant changes with respect to the widespread FORTRAN 77 standard: free form source code, array operations, modules and derived types to name but a few. To give an impression of what this means for the programmer, consider this simple problem: We have a file with numbers, one per line (to keep it simple) and we want to determine the distribution of these numbers, that is, produce a simple histogram. In FORTRAN 77 a program that does this might look like: * Produce a simple histogram * PROGRAM HIST INTEGER MAXDATA PARAMETER (MAXDATA = 1000) INTEGER NOBND PARAMETER (NOBND = 9) REAL BOUND(NOBND) REAL DATA(MAXDATA) INTEGER I, NODATA{\textquotedbl}--},

A series of significant revisions to the standard versions of the language have progressively enhanced its capabilities and the latest standard, Fortran 2008, includes many modern features, such as object orientation, coarrays for parallel programming, interoperability with C and various other enhancements.



Modern Fortran Explained expands on its predecessor, Fortran 95/2003 Explained. The opening chapters contain a complete description of Fortran 95, extended by Fortran 2003 allocatable array features. Coverage of the other additional features of Fortran 2003 follows, before new chapters on coarrays and the many other enhancements of Fortran 2008. The distinction between the three language levels is maintained throughout, allowing readers to understand and amend legacy code as well as the new features.



Authored by three experts in the field, two of whom have actively contributed to Fortran 2008, this is a complete and authoritative description of Fortran in its modern form. It is intended for new and existing users of the language and for all those involved in scientific and numerical computing. It is suitable as a textbook for teaching and, with its extensive Appendices and an Index, as a handy reference for practitioners.},

@article{Miehe.2002,
 abstract = {The paper investigates instability phenomena in the context of homogenization-based micro-to-macro transitions of heterogeneous materials at finite strains. This covers structural instability effects (buckling) and material instability effects (localization) which can occur on both the macro- as well as the micro-scale and may influence each other. We develop a general framework for the theoretical and computational treatment of these instability problems for elastic composites with given periodic fine-scale micro-structures. The key methodology is an investigation of the properties and the interaction of two coupled minimization principles which govern a micro-heterogeneous material in the context of a classical homogenization procedure: The principle of minimum potential energy of the macro-structure and the principle of minimum average energy of the micro-structure. The first variational problem determines the deformation field of the homogenized continuum. The latter yields the fine-scale fluctuation field on a composite micro-structure that is assumed to be attached to each local point of the macro-continuum. Global stability and the existence of solutions are based on weak convexity properties of these variational functionals. The convergence of non-convex homogenization functionals is based on the \textgreek{G}-limit of periodic heterogeneous micro-structures. It defines the relevant micro-structure as an a priori unknown critical ensemble of periodic cells that catches a possible minimizing buckling mode. We summarize these basic results and recast them in a consistent notation suitable for numerical implementation. Furthermore, we in detail discuss the discretization of the coupled minimization problems by means of finite element methods and point out numerical concepts for the detection of material and structural instabilities. The treatment provides a comprehensive guide to the classification and computation of instabilities in micro-heterogeneous solids. Focus is put on the interaction of micro- and macro-instability phenomena such as the loss of macroscopic material stability (localization) induced by a microscopic structural instability (buckling). The performance of the proposed computational methods is demonstrated for representative numerical model problems which treat coupled instability phenomena in micro-heterogeneous elastic composites.},

 abstract = {Composite aircraft structures are susceptible to impact damage during manufacture, maintenance and in-flight. Low energy impact damage is often internal and invisible, but can significantly reduce the stiffness and strength or cause catastrophic failure when the structure is under load during the impact event. This paper describes the development and application of an explicit finite element (FE) model, incorporating a bi-phase material degradation model, to predict the behaviour of loaded carbon/epoxy panels when impacted over a range of low energy levels. Overall, the trends predicted in the FE simulations were consistent with experimental data, although quantitatively the FE results were generally conservative. However, the model greatly underestimated the catastrophic failure boundary. The model was used to investigate the effect of various parameters including magnitude of preload, impact velocity and specimen geometry on the amount of damage and the residual strength of carbon/epoxy panels.},

 abstract = {Different micromechanical models for determining the stiffness and thermal expansion coefficients of short-fibre-reinforced thermoplastics are compared. For unidirectional orientation the model of Tandon and Weng, the self-consistent scheme and the Halpin--Tsai equations are used. The extension to arbitrary fibre orientation is done by orientation averaging of stiffnesses, compliances and so called `concentration' tensors. For the latter the orientation averaging procedure is extended with the help of orientation tensors to non-symmetric, transversly isotropic tensors. Furthermore, simplifications concerning the material symmetry are given, allowing the use of the classical thin-laminate theory to describe the composite. Finally, the values calculated with the different theories are compared with measurements on specimens from a specially designed experimental component. In this way it is possible to investigate different fibre orientation states, which are characteristic for injection-moulded short-fibre-reinforced components.},

This question is addressed in the context of SFRCs on the one hand with an overall transversal symmetric orientation distribution of fibers and, hence, effective transversally isotropic properties, and on the other hand with experimentally determined microstructure data using micro-computed tomography. Applying the maximum entropy principle, it is shown, how the fiber orientation distribution function (FODF) can be estimated by relying on the second and/or the fourth-order orientation tensor, only. Both estimates are used within the self-consistent and the interaction direct derivate approach to calculate the effective linear elastic properties. It is shown, that the predicted stiffness tensors significantly depend on the estimation of the FODF. Relative deviations of up to 20{\%} in terms of stiffnesses and up to 46{\%} in terms of Young's modulus are observed. For the experimentally determined microstructure, small deviations of up to 4.3{\%} are found.},

 abstract = {TO THE FIRST ENGLISH EDITION. In preparing this translation, I have taken the liberty of including footnotes in the main text or inserting them in small type at the appropriate places. I have also corrected minor misprints without special mention . The Chapters and Sections of the original text have been called Parts and Chapters respectively, where the latter have been numbered consecutively. The subject index was not contained in the Russian original and the authors' index represents an extension of the original list of references. In this way the reader should be able to find quickly the pages on which anyone reference is discussed. The transliteration problem has been overcome by printing the names of Russian authors and journals also in Russian type. While preparing this translation in the first place for my own informa tion, the knowledge that it would also become accessible to a large circle of readers has made the effort doubly worthwhile. I feel sure that the reader will share with me in my admiration for the simplicity and lucidity of presentation.},

@article{Odgaard.1997,
 abstract = {Recent development in three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of cancellous bone has made possible true 3-D quantification of trabecular architecture. This provides a significant improvement of the tools available for studying and understanding the mechanical functions of cancellous bone. This article reviews the different techniques for 3-D imaging, which include serial sectioning, X-ray tomographic methods, and NMR scanning. Basic architectural features of cancellous bone are discussed, and it is argued that connectivity and architectural anisotropy (fabric) are of special interest in mechanics-architecture relations. A full characterization of elastic mechanical properties is, with traditional mechanical testing, virtually impossible, but 3-D reconstruction in combination with newly developed methods for large-scale finite element analysis allow calculations of all elastic properties at the cancellous bone continuum level. Connectivity has traditionally been approached by various 2-D methods, but none of these methods have any known relation to 3-D connectivity. A topological approach allows unbiased quantification of connectivity, and this further allows expressions of the mean size of individual trabeculae, which has previously also been approached by a number of uncertain 2-D methods. Anisotropy may be quantified by fundamentally different methods. The well-known mean intercept length method is an interface-based method, whereas the volume orientation method is representative of volume-based methods. Recent studies indicate that volume-based methods are at least as good as interface-based methods in predicting mechanical anisotropy. Any other architectural property may be quantified from 3-D reconstructions of cancellous bone specimens as long as an explicit definition of the property can be given. This challenges intuitive and vaguely defined architectural properties and forces bone scientists toward 3-D thinking.},

In order to obtain the overall elastic properties, a homogenization procedure based on continuum micro-mechanics is usually applied to a representative volume element (RVE) representative of the whole composite. In this study, we first employ a modified random sequential adsorption algorithm to generate the complex geometry of a random fiber composite. Second, we investigate the effect of the interaction between two over-crossing fibers on the overall elastic properties of the composite. Third, we evaluate the overall elastic material properties of the composite using the finite element method for continuum micro-mechanical analysis.},

The aim of this study is primarily to understand the effects of the inclusion orientations in short-fiber-reinforced composites and to identify the basic mechanisms of interaction between the phases which govern the overall thermoelastic behavior. Perfectly aligned discontinuous fibers, various orientation distributions as well as two-dimensional and three-dimensional random orientations of the inclusions are studied. The overall Young's moduli, shear moduli and coefficients of thermal expansion, as well as the onset of yielding of the matrix phase under thermal and mechanical loading conditions, are calculated. The results are evaluated both in terms of the orientation distributions of the inclusions and in terms of the direction dependences of the predicted overall moduli. From these findings useful information on the appropriate requirements for the design of composite materials and composite structures can be obtained.},

 abstract = {We discuss three different ways of defining the strain measures in the non-linear micropolar continuum: (a) by a direct geometric approach, (b) considering the strain measures as the fields required by the structure of local equilibrium conditions, and (c) requiring the strain energy density of the polar-elastic body to satisfy the principle of invariance under superposed rigid-body deformations. The geometric approach (a) generates several two-point deformation measures as well as some Lagrangian and Eulerian strain measures. The ways (b) and (c) allow one to choose those Lagrangian strain measures which satisfy the additional mechanical requirements. These uniquely selected relative strain measures are called the natural ones. All the strain measures discussed here are formulated in the general coordinate-free form. They are valid for unrestricted translations, stretches and changes of orientations of the micropolar body, and are required to identically vanish in the absence of deformation. The relation of the Lagrangian stretch and wryness tensors derived here to the ones proposed in the literature is thoroughly discussed.},

 abstract = {Fibre orientation represents one of the most important micro-structural characteristics for fibre reinforced composite materials. Its influence on mechanical behaviour, material anisotropy and damage evolution has, especially with the modern trend to mass production of structural composite parts, moved back into the focus of micro-structural analysis. Following this development and the enormous improvements of X-ray computed tomography resolution and evaluation techniques in the field of composites the 3D analysis of fibre orientations throughout macroscopic components has become possible. Therefore, the complex connection between manufacturing process and manifested fibre architecture can be determined and correlated. Various image analysis methods exist in the material science and image analysis community which can be employed to extract fibre orientations of an image. In this work we compare three methods based on anisotropic Gaussian filtering, Hessian matrix calculation or structure tensor calculation in their ability to describe correct fibre orientations and their error-proneness with respect to imaging modalities and material composition. Those methods have become popular also in commercial software platforms for micro-structure analysis in user-friendly forms. All three algorithms were implemented with the open source imaging tool-kit ITK. In order to compare those methods, error estimates and testing procedures will be described herein.},

@article{Richard.2018,
 abstract = {At room conditions and standard strain rate (\textgreek{e}˙$\sim$10$-$4s$-$1), unidirectional (UD) plant-based reinforced organic polymers often exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviour in tension. A viscoelastoplastic model (VEP model) for the simulation of UD plant fibre composite mechanical behaviour in tension, previously validated from twisted flax yarn epoxy composite under room conditions and standard strain rate, is calibrated with new data obtained from flax fibre epoxy composite under repeated progressive loading and a wide range of strain rates (\textgreek{e}˙$\sim$10$-$3 to 10$-$7s$-$1). The VEP model does not reproduce well the experimental observations. There seems to be a lack of stiffening in this phenomenological model. We propose an improved VEP model, developed within the frameworks of thermodynamics and limited to uniaxial tension and infinitesimal strains. An internal variable s representing the stiffening is added to create a VEP-stiffening model. This internal variable represents the coupled effects of reorienting cellulose microfibrils in kink band areas, spiral spring-like extension of cellulose microfibrils, and shear-stress-induced crystallization of the amorphous cellulose of flax fibres. The stiffening phenomenon was considered viscous, without a threshold, and was related to the tension energy in the direction of the fibres. Three viscosity coefficients drive the three phenomena: \textgreek{h} (elastic), K (plastic), and Ks (stiffening). In the chosen formalism, this leads to two thermodynamic potentials \textgreek{f}VEPs and \textgreek{W}VEPs in which the stiffening phenomenon is strongly coupled with all the others. This VEP-stiffening model of the UD flax fibre epoxy composite correlates well with experimental observations. The paper also explores the evolution of the three viscous phenomena (elastic, plastic, and stiffening) by simulation of different loading conditions: monotonic, cyclic, and creep. This VEP-stiffening model can easily enrich existing multiaxial models of UD behaviour in the fibre direction. Implemented in a finite element model, it could be used at different length scales to numerically explore the origin of the mechanical behaviour of plant-based reinforced polymers.},

 abstract = {A novel method of describing elastic anisotropy based on the concept of an elastic eigen state is proposed. The structure of the rigidity tensor is determined. In particular, it is shown that the set of 21 constants describing continuously the manifold of elastic solids is composed of three different subsystems: 6 true rigidity moduli, 12 dimensionless rigidity distributors, and 3 invariant parameters defining the orientation of the body in question relative to the laboratory system of coordinates. It is shown that Hooke's Law can be written uniquely for an arbitrary anisotropic body in the form of several laws describing the direct proportionality of the corresponding parts of the stress and deformation tensors. The construction of these parts is illustrated using an example of a transversally isotropic solid.},

 abstract = {Kenaf regarded as an industrial crop in Malaysia and also grown commercially in other part of world for different applications. It is certainly one of the important plants cultivated for natural fibres globally, next to cotton, which is endemic to ancient Africa. It has great potential to use as automotive and construction materials due its long fibres derived from outer fibrous bark, the bast. Natural fibres such as kenaf getting attention of researchers and industries to utilize it in different polymer composites based products due to environmental awareness of consumers and government regulation in some countries. In many research studies, kenaf fibres are reinforced with polymer matrix to form fibre reinforced polymeric composites which perfectly improve the features of the polymers. Mechanical properties of kenaf fibres is comparable to existing materials and it will play an important role to utilize as the material of choice for a varied range of structural and non-structural industrial products with polymer matrix. The innumerable properties of kenaf fibres in original and reprocessed plastics are demonstrated by many recent studies and research efforts make it suitable construction materials (such as boards of different densities, breadths, along with fire and insect resistance). In this review work, we try to explore and highlights the previous work involving mechanical properties of kenaf fibre reinforced polymer composites to provide a perfect source of literature for doing further research in this topic to explore it as construction and building materials.},

@book{Sadd.2019,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Continuum mechanics modeling of material behavior offers a uniquely comprehensive introduction to topics like RVE theory, fabric tensor models, micropolar elasticity, elasticity with voids, nonlocal higher gradient elasticity and damage mechanics. Contemporary continuum mechanics research has been moving into areas of complex material microstructural behavior. Graduate students who are expected to do this type of research need a fundamental background beyond classical continuum theories. The book begins with several chapters that carefully and rigorously present mathematical preliminaries: kinematics of motion and deformation; force and stress measures; and general principles of mass, momentum and energy balance. The book then moves beyond other books by dedicating several chapters to constitutive equation development, exploring a wide collection of constitutive relations and developing the corresponding material model formulations. Such material behavior models include classical linear theories of elasticity, fluid mechanics, viscoelasticity and plasticity. Linear multiple field problems of thermoelasticity, poroelasticity and electoelasticity are also presented. Discussion of nonlinear theories of solids and fluids, including finite elasticity, nonlinear/non-Newtonian viscous fluids, and nonlinear viscoelastic materials are also given. Finally, several relatively new continuum theories based on incorporation of material microstructure are presented including: fabric tensor theories, micropolar elasticity, elasticity with voids, nonlocal higher gradient elasticity and damage mechanics{\textquotedbl}--Publisher's website.},

@article{Shim.2014,
 abstract = {Achilles tendon injuries including rupture are one of the most frequent musculoskeletal injuries, but the mechanisms for these injuries are still not fully understood. Previous in vivo and experimental studies suggest that tendon rupture mainly occurs in the tendon mid-section and predominantly more in men than women due to reasons yet to be identified. Therefore we aimed to investigate possible mechanisms for tendon rupture using finite element (FE) analysis. Specifically, we have developed a framework for generating subject-specific FE models of human Achilles tendon. A total of ten 3D FE models of human Achilles tendon were generated. Subject-specific geometries were obtained using ultrasound images and a mesh morphing technique called Free Form Deformation. Tendon material properties were obtained by performing material optimization that compared and minimized difference in uniaxial tension experimental results with model predictions. Our results showed that both tendon geometry and material properties are highly subject-specific. This subject-specificity was also evident in our rupture predictions as the locations and loads of tendon ruptures were different in all specimens tested. A parametric study was performed to characterize the influence of geometries and material properties on tendon rupture. Our results showed that tendon rupture locations were dependent largely on geometry while rupture loads were more influenced by tendon material properties. Future work will investigate the role of microstructural properties of the tissue on tendon rupture and degeneration by using advanced material descriptions.},

@book{Silhavy.1997,
 abstract = {This book presents the non-linear theories of continuum thermomechanics. Throughout, the author emphasizes issues that are foundational in nature and seeks results common to materials of arbitrary symmetry. The central part of the book deals with thermoelastic bodies with heat conduction and viscosity, including the inviscid or ideal dissipationless bodies. A surprising variety of phenomena can be modeled within this framework. Moreover, the main ideas can be transferred into more complicated theories of materials with memory or microstructure. A large portion is an extension of Gibbs' ideas to bodies of general symmetry by the methods of the calculus of variations. A progress there is recent. The interplay between the convexity properties of the stored energy functions, the resulting equations, and the physics of the phenomena are leading themes.},

@article{Sliseris.2016,
 abstract = {The ever-increasing demand of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites in various engineering applications calls for accurate predictions of their mechanical behaviors. In this study, numerical methods to generate and simulate mechanical properties of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites are proposed. The microstructures of short flax fibres with different fibre length-to-diameter ratios are generated by algorithm taking fiber defects (e.g. kink band) and fiber bundles into account. Bidirectional flax fabric is generated and discretized by tetrahedron 4-node finite elements. A brittle material law for fibre defects and interfacial zones of fibre bundles is proposed. Flax short fibre/polypropylene and flax fabric/epoxy composites are modeled by a non-linear plasticity model considering an isotropic hardening law and non-local continuum damage mechanics. The numerical modelling results are compared with the experimental results of these composites. This study shows that the simulation can capture the main damage mechanisms of the composites such as fibre breakage initiated at the fiber defects, damage of polymer matrix and the fibre debonding at fibre/matrix interface accurately. In addition, the simulation results exhibit good agreements with the experimental results in the aspects of elastic properties and nonlinear tensile stress-strain behavior of the short fibre and fibre fabric reinforced polymer composites.},

 abstract = {Compressive properties of 3 different natural fibre composites are measured, based on flax, bamboo and coir fibre. It was found that bamboo performs the best of these 3 natural fibres in compression. If the compressive properties are compared to the tensile properties it can be seen that flax and bamboo composites reach between 60{\%} and 80{\%} of the tensile values, which is very encouraging. Coir fibre composites even perform better in compression than in tension.},

Our models are based on a second order approximation of the strain energy density in terms of the fourth pseudo-invariant I¯4, typically employed in the description of fiber reinforced materials. For a particular choice of the strain energy density associated to the fiber reinforcement, it is possible to derive the explicit expression of the material and spatial stress tensors and of the stress covariance tensors. The mechanical behavior of the models is assessed through uniaxial, biaxial and shear tests.},

The Young's modulus, strain to failure and ultimate tensile strengths were determined individually and then Weibull distribution parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood method to quantify the variation. Single Data Set (SDS, standard) and Multiple Data Set (MDS) weak-link scaling (WLS) predictions were assessed using Anderson--Darling Goodness of Fit Numbers (GOFN). The use of MDS predictions provides better correlation with the experimental data than the standard weak-link scaling method. The authors recommend the use of MDS weak-link scaling for this problem with at least two points (but preferably three) with fibre lengths at two extremes (and, if used, the third point near the mean fibre length).},

This short communication considers the statistical variation in the two key fracture properties (strain and strength) for data obtained from tests on 785 jute technical fibres. The fibre strength does have high variability, which arises from the difficulty of determining an accurate fibre cross-sectional area (CSA). Failure strain is more consistent as this property is independent of the fibre cross-section. The authors therefore recommend that the use of failure strain as the key design criterion for natural fibre composites would expedite the adoption of these materials in the market.},

A directional data model of damage mechanics for composite materials will be developed using fabric tensors. The introduction of fabric tensors into the analysis of damage of composite materials will allow for an enhanced and better understood physical meaning of damage. The micromechanical approach will be used here to relate the damage effect through fabric tensors to the behavior of composite materials. In this approach, damage mechanics is introduced separately to the constituents of the composite material through different constituents' damage effect tensors. The damaged properties of the composite system as a whole can then be obtained by proper homogenization of the damaged properties of the constituents. The derivation of a generalized formulation of damage evolution will be shown here in a mathematically consistent manner that is based on sound thermodynamic principles. Numerical examples will be presented to show applicability. In addition, damage evolution for the one-dimensional tension case is also illustrated.},

This chapter presents theoretical foundations about elastic behavior of composite materials. A composite material is a heterogeneous solid continuum that bonds together a number of discrete homogeneous continua, each of which has a well-defined sharp boundary. It is understood that the bonding at the interfaces (and the continuity of each region) remains intact in the present circumstances where the entire mixture is to be placed in an equilibrated state of infinitesimal elastic strain by external loads and constraints. Each separate homogeneous region has its characteristic tensor of elastic moduli (in the stress--strain relation), which when anisotropic reflects a particular alignment of the crystallographic axes relative to the fixed Cartesian ones. A single phase consists of all those regions that share the same tensor of elastic moduli and perhaps also the same alignment of a geometrical shape and of crystallographic axes. This chapter presents an analysis of tensors and elastic behavior. The elastic field of a composite body is discussed. The overall elastic behavior of a composite body is also explained in detail.},

This study aims to investigate the strength characteristics of fiber composites under uniaxial tensile stress.

METHODS

A tensile failure finite element model based on fracture mechanics was built for fiber composites. The principal stress concentration-release-transfer evolution and the crack propagation of the composites under the conditions of equal single fiber width, unequal quantity, and equal total fiber width and unequal quantity were discussed.

RESULTS

The tensile strength of the composites increased with fiber quantity when the width of each single fiber was equal.

CONCLUSIONS

The tensile strength of the composites increased with fiber quantity when the total width of the composite fiber was equal.},

 abstract = {Reflecting current trends where object-oriented (OO) programming has taken over from imperative programming as the dominant paradigm, this book gives greatest prominence to OO programming using Java and C++ as the main exemplar languages. Similarly, since the Web has revolutionized the computing industry, the need for examination of scripting languages, such as Perl and Python, has risen. With additional case study languages including Python, Haskell, Prolog and Ada, Programming Language Design Concepts deepens study by examining the motivation of programming languages rather than just their features. All programmers, not just language specialists, need a thorough understanding of language concepts in order to get the best of these most fundamental tools. This book explains the basic concepts that underpin all programming languages, and shows how these concepts are synthesized in the major paradigms: imperative, object-oriented, concurrent, functional, logic and scripting. Written in a clear, approachable style, the book includes numerous examples, case studies of several major programming languages, and end-of-chapter exercises. Sample solutions to exercises are available on the companion website.},

@article{Weber.2019,
 abstract = {In the scope of linear anisotropic elasticity, the fourth-order elasticity tensor or tetrad has to be identified. This can be done either by measurements or by numerical simulations. An important task is then to identify a given tetrad, probably with some experimental or numerical scattering, with one of the symmetry classes. For this purpose one needs a distance function between a given tetrad and the class of all tetrads with a particular symmetry, which is zero if the tetrad obeys this symmetry, or non-zero otherwise. In this paper we present a fast method to solve these problems. We firstly introduce the 8th order projectors that map any stiffness tetrad into the part that is invariant under the action of a specific fixed symmetry group. For this purpose we consider the seven out of the eight symmetry classes that are distinguishable in linear elasticity. Secondly, since the symmetry axes of the specific stiffness tensor under consideration is generally not aligned with the used tensorial basis of the projector, we need to rotate the sample stiffness. The optimal orientation is obtained when the distance between the rotated stiffness and the rotated and projected stiffness is minimal. Thus, we need to apply only linear mappings and minimize over three Euler angles. The latter is quite simple, as the domain of the Euler angles is periodic, and the number of local minima is limited. This procedure has the advantage that it is applicable in an algorithmic manner, and does not require an a priori identification of symmetry planes, symmetry axes or component symmetries, which are only apparent under special choices for the tensorial basis.},

@incollection{Willis.1981,
 abstract = {Publisher Summary

This chapter focuses on variational and related methods for the overall properties of composites. A wide range of phenomena that are observable macroscopically are governed by partial differential equations that are linear and self-adjoint. This chapter is concerned with such phenomena for materials, such as fiber-reinforced composites or polycrystals, whose properties vary in a complicated fashion from point to point over a small, ``microscopic'' length scale, while they appear ``on average'' (that is, relative to the larger, macroscopic scale) to be uniform. This chapter treats the elastic behavior of composites, and emphasizes that a number of other properties (conductivity, viscosity of a suspension, etc.) are described by the same equations. Extensions to viscoelastic and thermoelastic behavior are presented, for both of which the variational characterization given is believed to be new. Problems, such as the resistance to flow of viscous fluid through a fixed bed of particles are mentioned, and a model problem that involves diffusion is presented in some detail. This displays the same difficulty in relation to divergence of an integral and is one problem of this type that has so far been approached variationally. Methods related to the Hashin--Shtrikman variational principle are also described in the chapter.},

@article{Zheng.2001,
 abstract = {For estimating the effective properties (elasticity, conductivity, piezoelectricity, etc.) of composites of the matrix-inclusion type, we develop a new micromechanical model, the effective self-consistent scheme (ESCS), based on the three-phase model. As a simplified and explicit version of the ESCS estimate, the interaction direct derivative (IDD) estimate is further proposed. The IDD estimate has an explicit and almost the simplest structure in comparison with other existing micromechanical estimates, with clear physical significance for all the involved components. It is universally applicable for various multiphase composites of the matrix-inclusion type, for any material symmetries of matrix, inclusions and effective medium, and distribution, shapes, orientations, and concentration of inclusions. Applications to effective elastic properties of composites with spherical inclusions and materials damaged due to voids of various shapes and microcracks (up to any high microcrack density) are presented, in comparison with a number of refined or accurate numerical simulation results. The IDD estimate seems to provide the best predictions in most of our examined cases. A further exploration of the proposed two estimates is given by Du and Zheng (Acta Mech. (2001), in press).},

@article{Zohdi.2001,
 abstract = {In this work, a method is developed to decompose or substructure large-scale micromechanical simulations into a set of computationally smaller problems. In the approach the global domain is partitioned into nonoverlapping subdomains. On the interior subdomain partitions an approximate globally kinematically admissible solution is projected. This allows the subdomains to be mutually decoupled, and therefore separately solvable. The subdomain boundary value problems are solved with the exact microstructural representation contained within their respective boundaries, but with approximate displacement boundary data. The resulting microstructural solution is the assembly of the subdomain solutions, each restricted to its corresponding subdomain. The approximate solution is far more inexpensive to compute than the direct problem. A posteriori error bounds are developed to quantify the quality of the approximate solution. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the essential concepts.},

@article{Zysset.1995,
 abstract = {Motivated by the mechanical analysis of multiphase or damaged materials, a general approach relating fabric tensors characterizing microstructure to the fourth rank elasticity tensor is proposed. Using a Fourier expansion in spherical harmonics, the orientation distribution function of a positive, radially symmetric microstructural property is approximated by a scalar and a symmetric, traceless second rank tensor. Following this approximation, a general expression of the elastic free energy potential is derived from representation theorems for anisotropic scalar functions. Based on a homogeneity assumption for the elastic constitutive law with respect to the microstructural property, a particular elasticity model is developed that involves three independent constants beside the fabric tensors. Strict positive definiteness of the corresponding elasticity tensor is ensured under explicit conditions on the independent constants for arbitrary fabric tensors.},
